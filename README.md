# 3D_Scene_By_Maurice_Wesley
This repository displays my work with OpenGL.

Everything that is shown in my 3D scene is something new that I learned and applied in my project. I can remember when I created my first window that had my name in the tope left corner. Now, I have primitives that form shapes with texture applied to a surface that reflects light.

I will continue to expand on the four pillars. OpenGL gave me an opportunity to work with pointers, pass by reference, data structures, and an API. Those are the ingredients for any software development project in the future. The course allowed me to apply all the knowledge that I learned in previous classes. I do not know my professional pathway. However, I will continue to build on the knowledge that this course has given me.

I will update this read me to contain more information in the future.
