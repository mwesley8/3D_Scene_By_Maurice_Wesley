# 3D_Scene_By_Maurice_Wesley
This repository displays my work with OpenGL.

Everything in my 3D scene is something new that I learned and applied in my project. I can remember when I created my first window that had my name in the tope left corner. Now, I have primitives that form shapes with texture applied to a surface that reflects light.

I will continue to expand on the four pillars. OpenGL gave me an opportunity to work with pointers, pass by reference, data structures, and an API. Those are the ingredients for any software development project in the future. The course allowed me to apply all the knowledge that I learned in previous classes. I do not know my professional pathway. However, I will continue to build on the knowledge that this course has given me.

The professor provided an example image that showed four objects.

After receiving permission, I started working on my interpretation of the bottles and eggs photo. The photo below displays my first attempt at recreating the 3D scene.

One of our previous assignments required us to display a complex 3D object with different colors at the vertices. The picture below uses 60 degree angles.

The picture below uses 3.6 degree angles.

Reducing the sector angle increases the number of sides that make up the circle. A 60-degree angle has to be drawn and rotated 6 times to create an object that can be perceived as a circle. The number of sides is calculated using the equation (360 / SECTOR ANGLE). A 3.6-degree angle has to be drawn and rotated 100 times to draw a circle. The circle has 100 sides but the object appears round with smooth edges.

The picture below shows my work with textures. Texturing a plane was covered in the tutorials and videos. The circular objects were more difficult to texture. I am not a fan of GL_REPEAT. However, I was able to apply texture without vertical lines.

The picture below shows my work with lighting. The instructor provided a material ambient color. I added some lighting and the looks like someone sprayed furniture polish over the entire canvas. The scene is with one single point light at the top. You can see the reflection in the back wall.

The picuture below displays my “final” interpretation. Point lights are located at the top left and top right of the back wall. Additionally, lights are located at the top center and behind the camera.
